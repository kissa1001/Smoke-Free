                <h4>Tips for Eating More Fruits, Vegetables, & Whole Grains</h4>
				<img src="img/healthy-food.jpg" alt="healthy-food" style="width:150px;height:150px; overflow:hidden;float:right;"/>
                <p>We all know fruits,  vegetables, and whole grains are an important part of a healthy diet. But most  people don&rsquo;t eat enough of these healthy powerhouses. An easy way to make sure  you&rsquo;re getting enough of the good stuff is to find new ways to mix them into  meals you already enjoy. And aim for making ½ your plate full of fruits and  veggies.</p>
                <h5>Try increasing your fruits, vegetables, and  whole grains by following these tips.</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Getting  more out of <u>Breakfast</u>:</strong><br>
                    Add some vegetables to  eggs for a veggie scramble or omelet. Or add fresh fruit to cereal, oatmeal,  low-fat yogurt, or whole wheat pancakes or waffles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting  more out of <u>Lunch</u>:</strong><br>
                    Add some vegetables to  your sandwich or wrap or have reduced- or low-sodium vegetable soup. Like tuna  or chicken salad? Try adding chopped apples, pears, raisins, or other dried  fruit. More of a lettuce or spinach salad person? Add beans—like black beans or  chickpeas.<br></li>
                    <li><strong>Getting  more out of <u>Dinner</u>:</strong><br>
                    Steam or stir-fry some  veggies to top off whole wheat pasta or brown rice. Make shish-kabobs by  putting lean meat and vegetables on a skewer. Use crushed, unsweetened whole  grain cereal as breading for baked chicken or fish. Next time you order (or  make) pizza, sub out one meat for more veggies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting  more out of&nbsp;<u>Snacks</u>:</strong><br>
                    Blend fruits with  low-fat yogurt and a splash of low-fat milk for a healthy smoothie. Cut up  fruits and veggies and eat them with hummus or peanut butter or other nut  butters. Try a mix of unsalted nuts, raisins, or other dried fruit and your  favorite whole grain cereal. Snack on popcorn (easy on the salt and butter) or  try some whole wheat pretzels.</li>

                <h4>Prepare to Quit</h4>
                <h5>1. Set a Quit Date</h5>
	            <p>Pick a date within the next two weeks to quit smoking. This will give you enough time to prepare. Really think about your quit date. Avoid choosing a day where you know you will be busy, stressed, or tempted to smoke (for example, a night out with friends, days where you may smoke at work).</p>
                <h5>2. Tell Family and Friends You Plan to Quit</h5>
	            <p>Quitting smoking is easier when the people in your life support you. Let them know you are planning to quit. Explain how they can help you quit. We all need different things, so be sure you let friends and family know exactly how they can help. Not sure what you need? Here are a few ways to <span class="caps">START</span> the conversation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tell family and friends your <a href="reasons-to-quit">reasons for quitting</a>.</li>
                    <li>Ask your friends and family to check in with you to see how things are going.</li>
                    <li>Identify your <a href="cravings">smoking triggers</a>, and ask your friends and family to help you deal with them.</li>
                    <li>Ask your friends and family to help you think of smokefree activities you can do together (like going to the movies or a nice restaurant).</li>
                    <li>Know a friend or family member who smokes? Ask them to quit with you, or at least not smoke around you.</li>
                    <li>You are going to be tempted to smoke. Ask your friends and family not to let you have a cigarette—no matter what.</li>
                    <li>Let your friends and family know that you may be in a bad mood while quitting; ask them to be patient and help you through it.</li>
                    <li>Do you take any medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist you are quitting. You may need to change your prescriptions after you quit.</li>
                </ul>
	            <p>Support is one of the keys to successfully quitting. Check out <a href="/talk-to-an-expert">additional support options</a> to help you quit.</p>
                <h5>3. Anticipate and Plan for Challenges While Quitting</h5>
	            <p>Quitting smoking is hardest during the first few weeks. You will deal with uncomfortable feelings, temptations to smoke, withdrawal symptoms, and cigarette cravings. An important part of preparing to quit is anticipating these challenges. To get a head <span class="caps">START</span>, be aware of the following:</p>
		            <h6>Uncomfortable Feelings</h6>

                <p>The first few weeks after quitting, a lot of people may feel uncomfortable and will crave a cigarette. This is because of <a href="/withdrawal">withdrawal</a>. Withdrawal is when your body gets used to not having nicotine from cigarettes. Nicotine is the chemical found in cigarettes that makes you want to keep smoking. Some of the more common feelings that come with withdrawal are:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Feeling a little depressed</li>
                <li>Not being able to sleep</li>
                <li>Getting cranky, frustrated, or mad</li>
                <li>Feeling anxious, nervous, or restless</li>
                <li>Having trouble thinking clearly</li>
                </ul>

			    <p>You may be tempted to smoke to relieve these feelings. Just remember that they are temporary, no matter how powerful they feel at the time. </p>

                <h6>Smoking Triggers</h6>

			    <p>Triggers are specific persons, places, or activities that make you feel like smoking. It is important to know your <a href="/cravings">smoking triggers</a> so you can learn to deal with them.</p>

		        <h6>Cravings</h6>

			    <p>Cravings are short but intense urges to smoke. They usually only last a few minutes. Plan ahead and come up with a list of short activities you can do when you get a craving.</p>

                <h5>4. Remove Cigarettes and Other Tobacco From Your Home‚ Car‚ and Work</h5>

                <p>You will be tempted to smoke during your quit. Stay strong; you can do it! Removing things that remind you of smoking will get you ready to quit. Try these tips:</p>
          
                <ul>

			    <h6>Don't Use Other Products with Tobacco</h6>

	            <p>Thinking about using other tobacco products instead of cigarettes? Think again. All tobacco products contain harmful chemicals and poisons. Despite their name, light or low-tar cigarettes are just as bad as regular cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco‚ pipes‚ cigars‚ cigarillos‚ hookahs (waterpipes)‚ bidi cigarettes‚ clove cigarettes‚ and herbal cigarettes also hurt your health.</p>

	            <p>No matter how they are presented in advertisements‚ all tobacco products are dangerous.</p>
